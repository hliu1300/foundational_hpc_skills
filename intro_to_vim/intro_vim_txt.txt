	    k
	    ^
	h <   > l
	    v
	    j


	zz - center cursor on screen

Getting from a to b: Motions
===
Basics: wWbBeE

	word vs. WORD
	word -- ends at a non-word chatacter, like ".", "-", or ")"
	WORD -- white-space delimited
	
	Moving by word is generally more fine-grained than moving by WORD.

	w - Forward to the beginning of next word
	W - Forward to the beginning of the next WORD
	b - Backward to the next beginning of a word
	B - Backward to the next beginning of a WORD
	e - Forward to the next end of word
	E - Forward to the next end of WORD

	w                             W
	----->--->---->------->---->  ----------------------------->
	These are some example words, words/with/special/separators (and also others!). Cool, huh? 
	
	
	$  - Move cursor to end of line             
	0  - Move cursor to start of line
	^  - Move cursor to first non-blank character of line
	g_ - Move cursor to last non-blank character of line

Slightly less basic: fFtT
All follow [(n)um]<verb><n(o)un> syntax

	[n]f<o> - Forward until (nth) (o)  (Inclusive)
	[n]F<o> - Backward until (nth) (o) (Inclusive)
	[n]t<o> - Forward until (nth) (o)  (Exclusive)
	[n]T<o> - Backward until (nth) (o) (Exclusive)

	abcdefg, abcdefg, abcdefg
	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.


Searching
===

	/  - Forward
	?  - Backward
	*  - Word under cursor - forward
	#  - Word under cursor - backward
	n  - Next result, forward in direction of search
	N  - Next result, backward in direction of search


Copy/Paste

	y  - Yank. Example: yw (yank word)
	yy - Yank current line
	p  - paste after cursor
	P  - paste before cursor
